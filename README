For those wondering what this repo is: This repo contains template code for (UC Berkeley Fall 2015) CS 70 homeworks, so that beginners can save a bit of time.





The following are the main content for each assignment:
    general.tex
    hw1.tex
    hw2.tex
    ...

The following are some customization:
    common/CS-70.tex
    common/myname.tex

The following are for the human-readable layer.  First three are the CC icon that appears at the end of the document.  latex.tex is a piece of LaTeX code that contains license information, so that we can simply \include it in several documents without having to type it out again and again.
    license/cc_by-sa.pdf
    license/cc_by-sa.pdf_tex
    license/cc_by-sa.svg
    license/latex.tex

The following is for the machine-readable layer.  You don't see it directly in the document.  However, it allows certain softwares to obtain information like who the author is, what license the document is released under, etc., which is hard to extract from the visual, human-readable layer.  For example, if you open the compiled PDF file in Evince (the default PDF viewer for GNOME and Unity), you can find the licensing information in Files > Properties (or sth like that).
    license/cc_by-sa.xmp

The following files are byproducts of compilation:
    license/cc_by-sa.xmpi
    BLAHBLAH.aux
    BLAHBLAH.log
    BLAHBLAH.out
They are safe to delete.

To adapt this template, you only need to change the following files:
    ASSIGNMENT_NAME.tex
    license/cc_by-sa.xmp
    common/myname.tex
Replace all “YOUR NAME” and “YOUR EMAIL” and that's it.
